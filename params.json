It doesn't save the\r\nthings you do. And it can be hard to tell that you're in that state. So then you\r\ncommit your code and you miss out on the unsaved changes.\r\n\r\nIt makes you want to rage!\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/1M1F1W0z1N3E033k111c/fuuuu-rage-guy1.png)\r\n\r\nUntil now!\r\n\r\nThis Visual Studio Extension saves everything ALL THE DAMN TIME!\r\n\r\nThat's it.
